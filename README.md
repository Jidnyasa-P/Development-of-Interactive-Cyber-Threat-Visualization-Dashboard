# 🛡️ Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard

## 📌 Project Title

**Development of an Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard for Real-Time Network Monitoring**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard is a real-time network monitoring system designed to analyze, detect, and visualize potential cyber threats within a network environment. The system provides security analysts and IT administrators with an intuitive interface to monitor suspicious activities such as unauthorized IP access, abnormal traffic patterns, and potential malicious devices connected to the network.

This dashboard helps in:

* Real-time threat monitoring
* Network topology visualization
* Suspicious IP verification
* Device-level analytics
* Security-based decision making
